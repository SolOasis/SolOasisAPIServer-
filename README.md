# drone API Server

## Prerequisites:

* python 2.7, with threading support
* [bybop](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=bybop&version=0.0.6)


## Status

This project is a work in progress, and thus is not stable, in every possible way:
 * Current error handling is almost non-existant (so most error will lead to a crash)
 * Current API (Bybop_Device) is non-final and will probably change in the future
